**SimConnect API Connector**

This package provides a convenient way to interact with the SimConnect API that takes the hassle out of dealing with the polling behavior of the API.

See the [examples](examples) for sample code. The [fuelhack example](examples/fuelhack/) provides the simpliest example of the API.
